# My fractal sandbox :)

Started as a test project for OpenCL acceleration of the noise computations for Cycles of War, the Fractal Explorer instantly began a life of it's own. It became a sandbox to play around, not only with noise algorithms, but also fractals. Later, Iterated Function Systems (IFS), Attractors, Buddhabrot were added.

It is a convenient framework to add new algorithms. Details can be explored interactively, functions can be combined, color schemes can be selected. Everything can be animated and captured to video.
